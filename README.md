## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Apple Music
    - The Lyrics Page
    - The background colors macthing the album art
    - The animation between skipping songs
    
Photos App
    - The animation when opneing a photo
    - The range of chaning dates of when the photos were taken that are on screen
    
Weather app
    - The animation of what the weather looks like outside
    - Animation of rain drops when its raining
    
    I would like to build a music play app that has some of the same features as Apple music. I really want to focus on the animations and make it pretty. Some of the key features could be a color gradient background thats based off the album artwork, a simple playlist feature, the ability to play local music, forward and back functionality.
